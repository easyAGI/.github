https://github.com/easyAGI/ezAGI # first "USEFUL" reasoning point of departure as multi-model expression UIUX with coherent logging to showcase reasoning enhancement from logical expressions<br />

---> extrapolated into development zone https://github.com/easyGLM/ezAGI<br />

where here, at easyAGI, is where all of the components will come together<br />
